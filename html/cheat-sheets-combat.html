                <li class="indented">Example: THAC0=15, attack roll is 10, so 15-10 means the character hits AC 5 or higher (worse)</li>

            <h3 class="h3">Order of Combat</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="indented">
          <p>Combat is broken up into rounds, each roughly 1 minute long.  Each round contains the following steps:</p>          
          <ol>
              <li>Check for surprise (first round only if applicable)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Each individual rolls 1d10, applying Reaction Adjustment (Dexterity).  </li>
                <li>Surprised only on a 1-3</li>
              </ul>
              <li>DM secretly determines NPC actions</li>
              <li>Players announce actions in whatever order they please</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Actions should contain reasonable specifity.</li>
                <li>For attacks, targets should be identified.</li>
                <li>For moves, the destination should be stated.</li>
              </ul>
              <li>Each group rolls 1d10 for initiative (lower is better)</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Combatants add Weapon Speed </li>
                <li>Spellcasters add Casting Time</li>
                <li>Simultaneous initiative is possible</li>
                <li>Note that Dexterity does not alter initiative in this game</li>
              </ul>
              <li>DM starts initiative count-up starting at 1</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Actions are resolved in sequence</li>
                <li>All actions in same segment are resolved before results applied to battlefield</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Two combatants who attack each other in the same segment could very well kill each other</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Combatants have limited ability to change action if situation changed mid-combat</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Attackers may opt to attack other targets, but only if they are within 5' (one square) of their original target.</li>
                  <li>For moves, an individual may elect to move less than the distance they indicated when declaring their action, i.e., abort part
                  or all of their move.  However, they cannot change their movement path, only shorten it.  They cannot otherwise change their action, 
                  however.  For example, a player announces that he will make a Full Move toward his enemy, but during the resolution phase his 
                  enemy moves closer, so he only moves his movement rate, not double.  He could not change his action from Full Move to 
                  Move-and-Attack; he can only choose to not move double his movement rate as he had originally declared.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Spellcasters start their casting on segment 0 and the spell goes off on the segment they act on</li>
              </ul>
              <a name="staggered-resolution"></a>
              <li>Staggered resolution of multiple attacks</li>
              <ul>
                <li>For combatants who make multiple attacks with the same weapon, Step 5 will start over for all characters to make their 2nd attack, 3rd attack, etc.</li>
                <li>Initiative is not re-rolled for these staggered attacks, so they will be resolved in exactly the same order as the first series of actions for the round.</li>
              </ul>
          </ol>

          <p><em>This is a summary of the rules on p. 132 of the PHB.</em></p>
          <p>It's important to realize that in melee, combatants are constantly moving around.  Therefore it's very difficult for an attacker
          firing into melee to reliably target a specific individual.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When firing into a melee, you declare your target.</li>
            <li>The DM then counts the number of figures in the immediate area, including both opponents and allies of the attacker.</li>
            <li>Each Medium figure counts as 1, larger figures count more, and smaller less.</li>
            <li>This will result in a number, and the DM secretly rolls a die determining which combatant the attacker is actually attacking.</li>
            <li>The attacker makes his attack roll, indicating what AC he hits, and the DM indicates which combatant he hit.</li>
