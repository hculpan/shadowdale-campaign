        </div>
        <div class="indented">
          <p>
            If you specify a target to attack, you may change that target during the resolution phase (i.e., after 
            initiative is rolled), but only to a target that is within your normal reach of the original target.  For
            most characters, this will be 5', so your new target must be within 5' of your original target.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your original target is Large or greater in size, you can only target an opponent within your reach of the
            original facing of the target that you would have attacked.  Note that you cannot move after your first attack,
            so if you're switching targets after your first attack, this may put opponents out of range even if they are
            within 5' of your original target.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a fighter announces that he will perform a Move and Attack action to move over to a stone giant
            and attack.  But when it finally comes to his action, the stone giant has been slain.  He can alter his move slightly
            to target another enemy if that enemy was within 5' of the stone giant's front facing.   On the other hand,
            if the fighter slays the stone giant with his first attack, he could only attack other enemies with his subsequent
            attacks in that round if they were within 5' of his current location.

          <p>
            If you announce a destination of movement during the planning phase of the round, you must make a good
            faith effort to reach that destination, even if it no longer makes sense for your character.  You can
            alter your destination in two ways, however:
            <ol>
              <li>
                You may abort any or all of your movement.  This does not allow you to replace your movement
                with any other action, however.  For example, say that you announced that you will Move and Attack,
                with a specific goblin being your target.  But he acts first and moves to you.  You can abort your 
                move so that you stay in melee with the goblin, but you would still be limited to only one attack
                rather than taking your full attack, i.e., you can't change your action from Move and Attack to 
                Full Attack just because you didn't actually move.
              </li>
              <li>
                You may change your destination to within 5' or your original target location.  For example, say
                you announce you will do a Move and Attack to attack a goblin, who dies before your action comes
                up.  Since players do not always need to announce their exact destination, a clever player could
                use this to change their destination more than 5'.  For example, since you can attack the goblin
                from any of multiple squares, after realizing the goblin is dead, you could say that you would have
                attack from the square to the right of the goblin rather than the one in front of him, and then change
                you destination to 5' from there.  This is permitted within reason.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>

            <h3 class="h3">Movement Through Threatened Zones</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>
              When a combatant enters a space adjacent to an enemy combatant equipped with melee weapons or natural melee attacks, that combatant 
              must immediately cease movement.  This limitation does not apply when passing through adjacent spaces of characters 
              using ranged weapons or otherwise unable to make a melee attack.  Nor does this apply if you started your movement within
              the threatened range of the enemy, unless you move out of their threatened range and then back in.  
            </p>
            <p>
              If your movement is stopped because of this rule, and assuming you still have an attack available (i.e., you were performing
              a Move and Attack action or a Charge), you cannot attack the enemy you just encountered unless they were originally your chosen
              target or within 5' of your chosen target.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="h3">Damage and Dying</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="indented">
            <p>
              In the core rules, characters die at 0 hit points.  In this game, characters will go unconscious at 0 hit points.  
              Each round thereafter they will lose 1 hit point, eventually dying when they reach -10.  Damage taken will never take them 
              from positive to negative hit points; instead, if a character takes more damage than they have in hit points, they will be reduced to 0.  
            </p>
            <p>
              A character may stabilize in one of two ways.  First, another character may spend a round tending their wounds, 
              which will immediately stop further loss of hit points.  However, the unconscious character will remain unconscious.  
              Second, another character may apply healing magic.  This will immediately restore the character to 1 hit point, 
              irrespective of the amount of healing done.  However, they are weak and feeble.  They can take no strenuous actions such 
              as fighting or casting a spell and can only move at half-speed.  They will remain in this condition until they have had 
              one full day of rest (no exertion or traveling).  Further healing will do the character no good until they have recovered.
            </p>
            <p>
              A heal spell is the only healing spell that can restore a character from negative hit points to full health without need 
              for a day of rest.  Any spells the character may have known are still wiped out, however.
            </p>
            <p>
              Magical regeneration is equally ineffective at restoring the character as other heal spells.  It may return the character to
              1 hp, but thereafter it cannot heal the character until they have had a full day of rest.  Natural regeneration, i.e., due to
              a high Constitution score, will eventually restore the character to full health, but they will remain weak and feeble, as described 
              above, until they recover half their full hit points.  Magical healing will not help them get to half their hit points, but once
              they reach this threshold, they can act normally and healing magic will have its normal effect.

        <div class="indented">
            If a combatant rolls a natural 20 on an attack roll and hit their target, they will score a critical hit.  They will roll 
            double the number of dice for the attack, but all static modifiers will be added only once.  This applies to any attack (including spells) 
            where an attack roll is made, but not those where the target makes a saving throw.

          use, if they have several different attacks.  The opponent must have the weapon readied, however; they
          cannot suddenly draw a larger sword to do more damage.

            <li>As explained in the <a href="#movement-through-threatened-zones">Movement Through Threatened Zones</a>, any movement
            through an enemy's threatened space immediately halts the charger's movement.  The attacker may not make an attack until
