        <p>
            This is a campaign set in Shadowdale in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.  Since
            the game will be using the AD&D 2nd Edition ruleset, the campaign will start off in 1368 DR.
            This is the setting as presented for use with the AD&D 2nd Edition rules.

            Just a small word of warning: If you use the Internet as a source of information, be aware
            that you will usually find information on the Forgotten Realms for later years, i.e.,
            the default settings for later editions of D&D.  So you need to make sure that whatever
            you check is valid for 1368 DR.

        <p>
            And finally, be aware that this is <em>my</em> Forgotten Realms, so anything you learn from
            an "official" source may or may not be true.

            To create your character, please look at the <a href="html/house-rules-character-creation.html">
            House Rules - Character Creation</a> rules, but otherwise follow all the rules

        <h5>A note on sources</h5>
        <p>
            We will be using the revised version of the rules, the so-called
            2.5 version that was reprinted in 2013.  You can acquire the <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/16868/Players-Handbook-Revised-2e"
            target="_blank">Player's Handbook</a> on Drivethrurpg. We will be using the rules as written,
            except as noted in the House Rules section (see menu above).
        </p>
        <p>
            One aspect of AD&D 2E is that there is a <em>lot</em> of supplamental material.
            Although I am not encouraging anyone to pull from these sources, neither am I
            explicitly disallowing them.  If you wish to use anything from a supplament, please
            check with me first.  Also bear in mind that if I allow something and it turns out
            to be unbalancing, I reserve the right to adjust ("nerf") the feature in the future.
            I will, however, work with the player on this and try to come to some accomodationg
            that is acceptable to all.
